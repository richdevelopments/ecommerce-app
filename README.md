This an e-commerce project that displays products for sale, allowing customers to search for and add products to a cart, and then pay for the products with a credit or debit card. Writen using Django.
I used Stripe, which is a tool for Internet commerce that allows both private individuals and businesses to accept payments.
I also used the Amazong Web Service S3 to serve the static and media files.

The site was deployed to Heroku -
